<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana">Aodix v4 Features Overview</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aodix v4 is a professional audio sequencer 
supporting ASIO 
audio and VST2 plug-ins. 
It has amazing editing and real-time features. You will be able to create music tracks using 
Aodix sequencer and external 
virtual plug-ins that comply with the VST standards (VSTi 
synthesizers and samplers; VST effects such as reverbs, filters and mastering tools).<br>
<br>
Aodix user interface is very close to a tracker's interface, but Aodix is not 
exactly a tracker. Actually, Aodix v4 is the first software to combine the 
simplicity of a tracker with the enhancements of a professional sequencer, and much more !<br>
<br>
<b>Why a tracker-like interface ?<br>
</b>Because the up/down scrolling of such an interface gives room for a 
complete parameter display. So, in Aodix v4, each event appears as an object, 
and all parameters are displayed in a very obvious way! So, the tracker-like 
interface is a very good starting point for all the features implemented in 
Aodix, and allows ambitious enhancements, even more that what could be imagined 
with more common interface systems.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Why more than a tracker :<br>
</b>Traditional trackers only provide step operation, text edition, very low 
real-time support, very basic routing schemes and 
many limits. Aodix 
v4 provides a fully graphic interface with object editing features as well as 
text-inside-object editing (for almost any parameter)!<br>
Also Aodix v4 is designed with a pure 
sequencing and hosting architecture. This is the way a sequencer is expected to 
work today. Sound generating is provided by external VST instruments plug-ins (VSTi 
synthes, samplers), and DSP is provided by external VST effect plug-ins. All 
these plug-ins are wired in a modular way allowing any imaginable scheme!<br>
Besides Aodix supports pure real-time, semi-realtime, and offline modes giving you more comfort 
while composing and editing. Serious real-time operation is made possible with 
the ASIO implementation.<br>
And, neither last nor least, the multi-pattern object-like support : you may 
program loops or part of your project in other patterns, and then call and scale 
them from precise points in your main arrange pattern.<br>
<br>
<b>Why much more than a common sequencer :<br>
</b>Aodix handles plug-in modular multi-pin routing, real-time operation, 
real-time offline editing (while transport is playing somewhere else), 
high-standard precision and object/text manipulation, in a very wise, enhanced 
and innovative way. Besides, Aodix supports a wide range of VST plug-ins. This 
is why Aodix cannot be compared to any common sequencer.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tracker-like pattern-based sequencer,&nbsp; 
with advanced keyboard and mouse based user interface</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aodix v4 user interface provides a layout 
inspired from trackers. The roll scrolls downwards, as in trackers. Editing is 
done using mouse and midi and/or PC keyboard. Aodix combines object and range 
editing for better user-friendly operation.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">256 patterns with virtually no length limit, 256 
independent markers and cue range</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is virtually no limit for pattern 
length. A whole song can fit into one pattern. Up to 256 markers can be set in a 
pattern, and a loop range can be defined inside each pattern.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">256 tracks</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Up to 256 tracks can be used. A track can hold 
single events as well as superimposed events (like chords)</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Timestamped events with quantization setting 
and accurate event positioning (up to 960 PPQN). Intelligent step and step-free operating mode</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aodix v4 handles several 
quantization settings and modes from basic step operation to full step-free 
operation. According to the recording mode, event position and length are 
detected and written in an &quot;intelligent&quot; and most &quot;natural&quot; way.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">VST2.3 full support, supports a very wide 
range of plug-ins</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aodix v4 complies to VST2.3 standards, and has 
been designed to support a very wide range of VST plug-ins (including plug-ins 
that are known to crash many sequencer software)</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Up to 256 instances of VST plug-ins</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aodix allows you to load up to 256 plug-ins in 
a project, as 
long as your computer has enough memory installed and enough CPU power.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Modular VST wiring, supporting multi-output</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Connect your plug-ins altogether using a visual 
routing scheme, allowing traditional send/insert scheme and any other scheme you 
can imagine, using all the inputs/outputs provided by your plug-ins.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Several recording modes, including real-time, 
editing, and editing while playing<br>
<br>
</b>Aodix has several editing and recording modes that you can toggle or 
combine (common, and less common modes).</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">VST Automation live recording</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to midiCC commands, Aodix is 
capable of recording VST automation events, that you can trigger with your mouse 
or with a knob/fader on your midi keyboard. Aodix allows you to assign a knob/fader 
of your midi keyboard to one or more VST parameters, in one ore more instanced 
plug-ins.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Full midi message acknowledgment and 
recording, midi message filtering through mask</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aodix is capable of understanding all midi 
messages, send them to the plug-ins, and record them. Aodix can filter any 
kind of messages, according to a fully configurable midi message mask.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pattern calls (non recursive), with 
parameter scaling</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You may play part of a pattern from another 
one, just as if it were a simple event, transposing, and scaling velocities.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">32-bit float sample precision and IEEE 
(multi-)file output</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aodix v4 uses the 32-bit float IEEE file format for 
rendering audio. This format is 32-bit floating-point, mono or multi-channel, 
and supports a wide range of 
sampling rates.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">ASIO input/output with extremely low latencies</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aodix v4 uses ASIO and achieves very low 
latencies (in our tests on fast computers : 1ms).<br>
Support for soundcards with no ASIO driver can be obtained by installing a 
third-party ASIO 
emulator/wrapper (not supplied).</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Import midi format files</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aodix can import midi format files in two 
different ways, in order to best fit the needs of the user.</font></p>
