I get no audio : </font> </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">please read carefully 
the <a href="gettingstarted.html"><font color="#008080">getting started</font></a> 
section.<b><br>
<br>
I still get no audio at all :</b> make sure that there is no other Aodix 
running, and no other software using the same ASIO driver.<br>
<br>
<b>I changed my audio drivers and/or audio card, since then Aodix crashes at 
start :</b> locate the configuration file &quot;Aodix.cfg&quot; and delete it. Open Aodix, 
configure it from scratch.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Aodix ignores my midi keyboard : </b>
make sure no other software is using it, and that you don't have two Aodixes 
running at the same time...<br>
<b><br>
I try to record notes, but only very short events are recorded : </b>if you are 
using offline modes, depending on what you are doing, check if Step in the Edit 
section in on. If you are using small Quantization values, check also that 
Pre-release is not approximately the same value as Quantize. Pre-Release should 
be quite smaller than Quantization value (in midi points) for regular offline 
operations.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I use mouse wheel to scroll 
up/down, and arrows, but it scrolls very slowly : </b>you are probably using 
free quantization. Set to a value like 16th.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I have other problems : </b>please browse to 
our website <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aodix.com"><font color="#008080">www.aodix.com</font></a>&nbsp;and 
consult the Support section.</font></p>
