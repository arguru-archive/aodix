<p><b><font face="Verdana"><a name="loadvst">1. First step : loading plug-ins to instance slots 
and wiring</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Decide about what VST instruments and 
effects you are going to use. First, let's worry about VST instruments.<br>
Switch from &quot;Sequencer&quot; to &quot;Routing&quot; view (<a href="detailed_desc.html#edit"><font color="#008080">Seq. 
Edit</font></a> section), point  
mouse at any empty slot of the <a href="detailed_desc.html#vstlist">
<font color="#008080">VST Instance List</font></a>, and click. If everything is 
properly configured, under the mouse you will see a small tree listing that reflects the 
structure of your VST Plug-ins folder. Select the plug-in you wish to load from 
there.<br>
<br>
As soon as the plug-in is loaded, it will appear as a box object (since we are 
looking at the <a href="detailed_desc.html#routing"><font color="#008080">&quot;Routing&quot; view</font></a>. 
If it is not automatically wired to the Master Output, draw the wires as 
explained in the&nbsp; <a href="detailed_desc.html#routing"><font color="#008080">&quot;Routing&quot; view</font></a><font color="#008080">
</font>section.<br>
<br>
In the case of a multi-output VST instrument, every output pin will be 
sequentially wired to a pin of the Master Output. Be careful because if some 
used Master Output pins are not assigned to audio outputs, you could hear no 
audio. So make sure they are assigned to audio outputs, or change the way the 
wires are connected...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We recommend that you begin with simple schemes.<br>
Schemes including VST effects are explained in <font color="#008080">
<a href="#finishing"><font color="#008080">Step 4 : Mastering and Finishing 
Project</font></a></font><a href="#finishing"><font color="#008080">.</font></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now that basic wiring is ok, you may begin to record your tracks !</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><a name="rec">2. Step 2 : recording first tracks</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>2.1. case 1. load a midi project<br>
</b>Use the importation function from &quot;File &gt; Import MIDI File ...&quot; menu item.<br>
You will be asked if you want to spread channels over several instances. Please 
report to section <a href="detailed_desc.html#menuitems"><font color="#008080">Menu 
Items</font></a>.<br>
Be careful : the file you import will be passed through the Midi-Mask. If you want 
a full import, just make sure that all the flags of the Midi-Mask are set ! (refer to 
the <a href="detailed_desc.html#edit"><font color="#008080">Edit</font></a> section).<br>
Also, Aodix will import the PPQN setting from the file. Do not change it.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">2.2. case 2. begin recording from scratch</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
First decide of the PPQN value (<a href="detailed_desc.html#audiomaster"><font color="#008080">Audio master</font></a>). 
It is not recommended that you change it in the middle of the progress of your 
project.<br>
Default is 192. And we<b> strongly recommend </b>that<b> </b>you leave it to <b>
192</b> !<br>
This is a setting for advanced users, and is intended to increase/decrease midi 
precision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Set project's Time Signature (<a href="detailed_desc.html#audiomaster"><font color="#008080">Audio 
Master</font></a>). The most used signature is 4:4.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Set project's Tempo (<a href="detailed_desc.html#audiomaster"><font color="#008080">Audio 
Master</font></a>). If you will only use one tempo for the whole project, then 
you just need to set it once. But, if you will be changing it within the 
project, then you will need to set it and to record it as automation, at the 
beginning of the tune, and whenever it is intended to change (read
<a href="detailed_desc.html#midiccvsautomation"><font color="#008080">Note 2</font></a> 
in the VST Parameters section).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, let's set quantize value (<a href="detailed_desc.html#edit"><font color="#008080">Edit</font></a> 
section). Use the default <b>16th</b> setting, or any other adapted to your 
project. You may change this setting whenever you want. Sometimes when recording 
you may like to set it to &quot;free&quot;. The quantize setting only acts as a grid to 
which inputted events stick.<br>
<br>
When composing your tracks, you will usually switch between these 
operating modes (<a href="detailed_desc.html#audiomaster"><font color="#008080">Audio 
Master</font></a>) :<br>
<br>
<b><u>With REC on :<br>
</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; record at the 
transport cursor position.<b><u><br>
<br>
Live off + Play :</u></b> 
special offline mode in which you record at any position you want (static)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meanwhile the 
song is playing/looping at transport position somewhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
else. It means that the transport cursor and the edit cursor are no longer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
the same cursor.<b><u><br>
<br>
STOP (live on or off):</u></b> 
offline mode with transport stopped. It's the classical editing 
mode for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; programming (typing in notes).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Press &quot;loop&quot; if you wish to play and record a loop inside the pattern.<br>
<br>
Switch the &quot;Over&quot; button off (<a href="detailed_desc.html#edit"><font color="#008080">Edit</font></a> 
section) if you wish to record more than one event 
at the same time (like chords). Read about other buttons in the (<a href="detailed_desc.html#edit"><font color="#008080">Edit</font></a> 
section). We recommend you leave &quot;Step&quot; on, in the beginning. Then you may find 
it useful to remove it.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><a name="arrange">3. Step 3 : Arranging Project</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="recordnotes">3.1 Record, type-in notes</a> 
and arrange</b><u><br>
</u><br>
Record your tracks by combining all possibilities (online/offline, play/stop, 
step on/off, etc).<br>
<br>
Use your midi keyboard and your PC keyboard.<br>
If operating with PC keyboard, you may find changing the &quot;Pre-release&quot; setting 
useful when programming a track.<br>
This setting is the value (in midi points) by which the event will be shortened. 
It has no effect on events incoming from a midi keyboard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For arranging, you need to read carefully all 
the <a href="detailed_desc.html#sequencer"><font color="#008080">Sequencer 
section</font></a>.<br>
<br>
You may find it useful to select a block and copy/paste it. For instance, for drum programming, you 
will probably worry about one measure, then replicate it to all following 
measures. Afterwards, you would modify some events (move/resize) of some 
measures. Moving and resizing objects are quantize-free operations, because they are 
intended for &quot;humanized&quot; results.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You may also use the special event &quot;jump&quot;  
(key 1). This event allows you to jump over the area defined but the &quot;jump&quot; 
object (which is resizable). This is useful if you wish to shorten a measure.<br>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Save your project several times while 
composing (<a href="detailed_desc.html#menuitems"><font color="#008080">Menu 
Items</font></a>). Some VST plug-ins can generate instability and crash, even though they are very 
good and professional.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When you achieve something consistent, you can think of modulating some parameters 
(volumes, filter cut-offs etc..).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="tweakparameters">3.2 Tweak parameters</a></b><u><br>
</u><br>
In order to tweak a plug-in's parameters, you may proceed using midi events if the 
plug-in you are using supports midiCC (midi Continuous Controllers), or using 
VST automation (supported by almost all plug-ins).<br>
<br>
Pros and cons of both methods :<br>
<br>
<u>MidiCC recording : </u>what you actually record is the midi event incoming 
from your keyboard. So you need a midi keyboard for that. Then this midi event 
is interpreted by the plug-in only if the plug-in supports midiCC. If this is 
the case, the plug-in will not always allow you to map the knobs as you wish. But 
if the plug-in allows it, then it uses some sort of internal matrix that you can 
edit. What happens if the matrix is modified for another project ? What happens 
if you play the tune on another computer which has the same plug-in but not same 
matrix ? You may not be able to play your tune as it is intended. The only 
advantage of this method is that it is not subject to audio driver latencies, 
which in all cases is extremely low in Aodix.<br>
=&gt; Record midiCC : just press REC and move the knobs and faders on your midi 
keyboard. Of course, in <a href="detailed_desc.html#midimask">
<font color="#008080">Midi Mask</font></a>, you must set the &quot;B&quot; flag.<br>
<br>
<u>VST automation :</u> first, unlike midiCC, you can record VST automation with 
your midi keyboard and with your mouse !! Then, recorded VST automation events carry the accurate information of the 
plug-in's parameter that is being modified. There is a subsystem in Aodix that 
allows you to assign a physical knob/fader of a midi keyboard to a parameter 
of your plug-in. Even though you change the assignments later, the recorded 
automation events will have exactly the same meaning. In addition, unlike midiCC, 
you may assign a physical knob/fader of your midi keyboard to one or many parameters 
in one or many plug-ins at the same time.<br>
=&gt; Record VST automation : first unset the &quot;B&quot; flag of the 
<a href="detailed_desc.html#midimask"><font color="#008080">Midi Mask</font></a><font color="#008080">
</font>to avoid midiCC interference. Then press AUT. Open the editor of the plug-in (interface) and move buttons with your 
mouse. The movements are recorded. If you wish to assign a physical knob/fader 
of your midi keyboard, refer to section : <a href="detailed_desc.html#vstparams">
<font color="#008080">Interface Detailed Documentation - VST Parameters</font></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="patterncalls">3.3 Use Pattern 
Calls</a><br>
<br>
</b>Although you may write your project as one single sheet and ignore this feature, we suggest 
you try it once you have good knowledge of Aodix operation.<br>
<br>
A pattern call is intended to allow you use part of a pattern as a single event 
in another pattern.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For instance, if you are working on pattern 00, 
switch to pattern 01, and arrange a loop containing one measure of 
drum/percussion events. If this measure does not begin at 000:0, then you will 
need to create a <a href="detailed_desc.html#s2"><font color="#008080">marker</font></a><font color="#008080">
</font>at the beginning of the measure.<br>
Now return to pattern 00. Set &quot;Mode&quot; value to &quot;Pattern&quot; (<a href="detailed_desc.html#edit"><font color="#008080">Edit</font></a> 
section). Press &quot;REC&quot; button.<br>
Press any letter key on our PC keyboard. This will create a &quot;Pat&quot; event. You 
will need to browse to the first parameter and replace it with the number of the 
pattern that is being called (in our case, it's &quot;01&quot;). Then browse to the second 
parameter and type the number of the marker from which you want to begin the 
call (or &quot;00&quot; if the measure is located at 000:0). Then set the two last 
parameters to scale the called events. You may move and resize the pattern call.<br>
<br>
Cues, jumps and Stop Marker from the called pattern are ignored 
in a pattern call event.<br>
Tempo changes from the called pattern are applied to global tempo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Read more about pattern calls in the
<a href="detailed_desc.html#s6"><font color="#008080">Sequencer : Event Syntaxes 
section</font></a><font color="#008080">.</font> You may create as many 
areas to be called in a pattern as long as you have enough markers to define 
their beginning point (point 000:0 and 255 markers you can place anywhere else).<br>
<br>
<b>Note 1:</b> the Start/End Cues and the Stop Marker that are part of a called 
area are ignored in the pattern call.<br>
<br>
<b>Note 2 : </b>you may not use pattern calls recursively : if the area you are 
calling contains itself a pattern call, the latter will be ignored.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><a name="finishing">4. Step 4 : Mastering and Finishing project</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We recommend that you finish the arrangement 
with a Stop Marker, wisely positioned some measures after your the event, 
so that the audio stream can decay before stop.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is time to add some effects to your project 
in the <a href="detailed_desc.html#vstlist"><font color="#008080">VST Instances 
List</font></a>, like delays, reverbs, equalization, compression, and more...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Add as many 
effects as you need and wire them so as the finally converge to the Master 
Output. <b>Do not create circular references</b>. 
You may decrease the gain of a wire but clicking on the arrow and dragging the 
slider down.<br>
<br>
Watch the CPU level (<a href="detailed_desc.html#audiomaster"><font color="#008080">Audio 
Master</font></a>), since some plug-ins have high CPU load consumption.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before rendering, You should play the whole 
song for mastering purpose. Add some mastering effects at the bottom of the 
global routing scheme. You may use the &quot;Stardust&quot; plug-in supplied with Aodix.<br>
<br>
You may also find that it is wiser to chose and load mastering plug-ins at the 
very beginning of a project. Keep this in mind for your next projects !</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Don't forget to save your work.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><a name="bounce">5. Result : Rendering project</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now it's time to write a file that you can 
later convert/encode to another file format with your audio editing software.<br>
<br>
Use the &quot;File &gt; Bounce...&quot; menu item (refer to section 
<a href="detailed_desc.html#menuitems"><font color="#008080">Menu Items</font></a>).<br>
<br>
If you choose to bounce Cue Range, then Aodix will render the loop within the 
cues.<br>
If not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if there is no Stop Marker in the pattern, Aodix will not even 
begin rendering your file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if there is a Stop Marker, then Aodix will begin rendering 
your file from position 000:0 and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will stop rendering when the Stop Marker is reached. You may 
also stop prematurely by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clicking on &quot;Stop&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The output file is a multi-channel 32-bit float 
IEEE file or a set of mono-channel 32-bit float IEEE files (to chose, tick or 
untick the &quot;Multifile&quot; checkbox).<br>
Most audio editing applications import stereo (2-channel) 32-bit float IEEE 
files. Other import any number of channels (for details, refer to section 
<a href="detailed_desc.html#menuitems"><font color="#008080">Menu Items</font></a>).<br>
